The Forecast and Trend Analysis Dashboard helps users predict future sales and analyze historical trends. Built with Streamlit, it offers an interactive experience for predictive analysis and visualizing complex data relationships. The intuitive interface allows users to specify forecast parameters, choose predictive algorithms, and interpret data correlations.

The sidebar lets users customize their analysis by selecting the number of forecast months, the forecast variable (e.g., sales), and predictive algorithms. This ensures relevant and tailored forecasts.

The main area features detailed visualizations. The "Sales Forecast using Simple Exponential Smoothing" chart shows historical and forecasted sales data, allowing users to compare and highlight future sales patterns. The "Correlation Matrix" heatmap shows correlations between financial variables like cost, profit, and sales, aiding informed decision-making. The "Financial Decomposition Analysis" chart breaks down sales data into trend and seasonal components, helping users understand sales performance drivers. The "Correlogram" shows autocorrelation plots, illustrating the persistence of trends over time and the influence of past values on future outcomes.
