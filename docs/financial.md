The dashboard provides an interactive way to monitor and analyze profit, cost, and sales data over time. It features a sidebar for filtering data by years and customizing the dashboard's color themes.

Key financial metrics like total profit and cost are displayed with percentage change indicators. Visual insights are provided through several charts: a stacked bar chart for cost, sales, and profit over time; a line chart for monthly sales figures; a trends line chart comparing monthly data; and a pie chart for expenditure types like Internet, KRA Penalty, Raw Materials, Rent, and Transport.

Powered by Streamlit and data visualization libraries like Vega-Altair or Matplotlib, the dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for financial performance analysis.
